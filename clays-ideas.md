I would suggest the following interesting questions

1. What is the relationship between rental prices and sales prices?
  * Do rent rates go up and down with sales prices?
1. What are the price per square foot pricing trends by subdivision
1. How do interest rates affect sales and rental prices and activity?

If we could augment this data with say,

1. Consumer Confidence levels at the time of closing
1. Overall employment or unemployment rates at time of closing
1. Census data such as demographic data, income levels, education levels, etcâ€¦
